# Car Rental
No car needed for Reykjav√≠k, everything is within walking distance.

It's best to rent from an established rental company like Hertz.
* Get full insurance on the car, including any additional gravel insurance.
* On pickup, inspect car very thoroughly for damages. Take pictures with smart phone! Make sure to show all damage to 
  rental company and get a receipt of them confirming such damage before taking the vehicle.
* Charging tourists for damage they didn't cause is a well-known scam in Iceland. Make sure to review all damage with 
  the rental company BEFORE leaving with the vehicle. Make sure they take notes of the existing damage and you get a 
  copy of the notes they take. Should be a carbon-copy form-like thing.
* Especially look at the door panel hinge areas, where the doors may have been forced beyond their normal max opening by
  high winds. Also dents made from flying gravel. There will most likely be significant existing damage on the car you 
  rent, and the car companies like to charge tourists for existing damage at time of rental return.

Be very careful when opening doors of the vehicle after parking. It can be extremely windy in some areas, and the wind
can whip the door open beyond its normal range causing extensive damage to the vehicle.

Fill up the tank whenever you pass a gas station, as gas is very rare out in the wilderness.
