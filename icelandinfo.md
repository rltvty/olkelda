## Food & Grocery
Food can be expensive, so go to Bonus in Reykjavik before starting your trip. Okay prices for the basics.

Tap water quality is good, no need to buy water. 
* Ask for still water in a restaurant = tap water in a carafe = free.

## Payment
Credit cards are commonly accepted. Cash works too.

Tipping is uncommon in Iceland. Bills have the gratuity or service charge included in the total, so don't tip.

## Reykjavik
Reykjavik is the capital city of Iceland, and contains about 75% of its population. Below are some ideas for what to do 
in Reykjavik before or after the wedding:
