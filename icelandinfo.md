## Food & Grocery
Food can be expensive, but Bonus grocery stores have okay prices for the basics:
* [Bonus - Laugavegur 59, Reykjavík](https://goo.gl/maps/2d4a3uoEcZT2) 

Tap water quality is good, no need to buy water. 
* Ask for still water in a restaurant = tap water in a carafe = free.

## Payment
Credit cards are commonly accepted. Cash works too.

Tipping is uncommon in Iceland. Restaurant and bar bills have the gratuity included in the total, so don't tip.

## Reykjavík
Reykjavík is the capital city of Iceland, and contains about 75% of its population. Below are some ideas for what to do 
in Reykjavík before or after the wedding:
