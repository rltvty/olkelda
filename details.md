# What to bring

* Don't bring presents :)

* Do bring functional clothes and good shoes for some smaller hikes.

* No need to bring festive outfits, we'll be quite casual, also when going out for dinner and at the ceremony. Just come as you are.

# Your stay in Iceland
* Airport to downtown https://iheartreykjavik.net/20...

## car rental

* best to rent via Hertz or another established rental company. 

* Get additional gravel insurance and inspect car very thoroughly for damages when getting it. Take pictures with smart 
  phone! Make sure to show all damage to rental company and get a receipt of them confirming such damage before taking 
  the vehicle.

* Charging tourists for damage they didn't cause is a well-known scam in Iceland. Make sure to review all damage with 
  the rental company BEFORE leaving with the vehicle. Make sure they take notes of the existing damage and you get a 
  copy of the notes they take. Should be a carbon-copy form-like thing.

* Especially look at the door panel hinge areas, where the doors may have been forced beyond their normal max opening by
  high winds. Also dents made from flying gravel. There will most likely be significant existing damage on the car you 
  rent, and the car companies like to charge tourists for existing damage at time of rental return.

* be very careful when opening doors of the vehicle after parking. It can be very windy in some areas, and the wind can 
  whip the door open beyond its normal range causing extensive damage to the vehicle.

* fill up tank whenever you pass by a gas station as latter can be very rare once you drive out in the wilderness.

## Food & grocery
* food can be expensive, so go to Bonus in Reykjavik before starting your trip. Okay prices for the basics.

* tap water quality is good, no need to buy water. Ask for still water in a restaurant = tap water in a carafe = free.

## Payment
* credit cards are commonly accepted. Iceland uses cards with the chip-and-PIN system, which requires a 4-digit PIN for 
  purchases. Cash possible too.

* tipping is uncommon in Iceland. Bills already have the gratuity or service charge included in the total, so don't tip.

## equipment
* sun blocker, sun glasses

* adapter for plug type F needed (if from US; not needed if from Germany)

* functional clothes, good shoes, hat, scarf

* bathing suits & slippers

## Traveling around Iceland
If you're planning to stay a couple of days in Iceland, you could do some nice day trips from Reykjavik or do part of 
the circle tour (mainly route no. 1 in the south). Ask us if you need help with your Iceland visiting plans!
